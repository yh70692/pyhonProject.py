# pyhonProject.py
All of my 2nd year python projects.

Throught 2022 my dev journey has mostly been baised on advancing my Python knowlage. I have learrnt all basics in Object-oriented programming, using pythons libaries (such as tkinter for GUI) as well as diving into the complex nature of diffrent algorythms (e.g sorting algorythms) that exist to solve many diffrent real world problems. Atterning a firm knowlage in all the concepts in a matter of months is difficult but that is not enough to discrage me on hunting for the surpant that is python :)
